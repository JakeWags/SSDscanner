# SSD Scanner

This script is made to scan reddit's [/r/buildapcsales](reddit.com/r/buildapcsales "/r/buildapcsales") subreddit for sales on 2.5 inch SSD's.

It uses the javascript reddit api wrapper, [snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap "snoowrap") by [not-an-aardvark](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark "not-an-aardvark").

It also uses __dotenv__ to securely save and use environment variables for authentication with reddit.

Consider using [not-an-aardvark's](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark "not-an-aardvark") package, [reddit-oauth-helper](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper "reddit-oauth-helper") if you are struggling with authentication.
